//! What remote-control-conductor-server and its clients share: reading Claude
//! Code's files (transcripts, the account a config directory is signed in
//! under, the registry of running sessions), running a program with a time
//! limit, the API between the two, the pairing code, and — with the `tls`
//! feature — trusting a server by its certificate's fingerprint. Moving,
//! archiving and merging memory on a host are the server's own. No platform
//! code, so the server can build it for Linux.
